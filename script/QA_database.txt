[Ans:]
Since the KE69X0 uses standard IP protocols to transfer media and data, 
in theory there are no distance limitations, however, there are limitations 
inherent with network devices(hubs, switches, routers, etc.),
bandwidth considerations,and network device settings (IGMP).

[Ans:]
For best results, we recommend a Giga LAN network switch or a router with IGMP functionality.
For detailed requirement, please see the criteria below.Dedicated Non-Blocking switch is 
preferred in order to prevent congestion from one switch to another when interconnection is 
needed or applied.Gigabit (1000 Mbps) or faster Ethernet ports is recommended Support IGMP v2 
or v3 snooping (Multicast) Supports IGMP Querier Multicast routing switch is needed for 
different IP segments High bandwidth connections between switches, preferably by fiber channel
Check the throughput of the switch and ensure the up and downstream data speed of each port 
is 1 Gigabit per second Using switches from the same manufacturers throughout the entire 
installation to meet the best compatibility and to prevent the incompatibility, if possible
